# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Express.js + MongoDB API Generator is a core feature that enables users to quickly generate production-ready REST APIs using the most popular Node.js stack. Users should be able to describe their API requirements in natural language through the chat interface and receive a complete, deployable Express.js application with MongoDB integration, including models, routes, middleware, authentication, validation, and deployment configuration.

This feature focuses on generating high-quality, production-ready code that follows best practices for Express.js and MongoDB development, including proper error handling, security measures, testing, and documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe my API requirements in natural language and receive a complete Express.js + MongoDB application, so that I can quickly prototype and deploy REST APIs without writing boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes their API in the chat interface THEN the system SHALL generate a complete Express.js application with proper project structure
2. WHEN the system generates code THEN it SHALL include package.json with all necessary dependencies for Express.js and MongoDB
3. WHEN the API is generated THEN it SHALL include proper folder structure (routes, models, middleware, controllers, config)
4. WHEN the user requests specific features THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding Express.js routes and MongoDB models

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated API to include proper MongoDB integration with Mongoose, so that I can have robust data modeling and database operations out of the box.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates models THEN it SHALL create Mongoose schemas with proper field types, validation, and indexes
2. WHEN models have relationships THEN the system SHALL implement proper MongoDB references and population methods
3. WHEN the API includes CRUD operations THEN it SHALL generate controllers with proper MongoDB queries and error handling
4. WHEN the database configuration is created THEN it SHALL include connection handling, error management, and environment-based configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated API to include authentication and authorization, so that I can secure my endpoints without implementing auth from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is requested THEN the system SHALL generate JWT-based authentication with login, register, and token refresh endpoints
2. WHEN authorization is needed THEN the system SHALL create middleware for role-based access control and route protection
3. WHEN user management is required THEN the system SHALL generate user models with password hashing and validation
4. WHEN security is a concern THEN the system SHALL include security middleware (helmet, cors, rate limiting)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated API to include proper validation and error handling, so that my API is robust and provides clear feedback to clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL include input validation using libraries like Joi or express-validator
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-specific messages
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle MongoDB errors gracefully with appropriate client responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated API to be production-ready with proper configuration and deployment setup, so that I can deploy it immediately without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is generated THEN it SHALL include environment configuration with development, staging, and production settings
2. WHEN deployment is considered THEN the system SHALL generate Docker configuration and deployment scripts
3. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL include logging, health checks, and basic monitoring endpoints
4. WHEN the API is complete THEN it SHALL include comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger specification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated code to follow best practices and be well-tested, so that I can maintain and extend the API with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN it SHALL follow Express.js and Node.js best practices for structure and patterns
2. WHEN the API includes business logic THEN it SHALL separate concerns with proper controller, service, and model layers
3. WHEN testing is required THEN the system SHALL generate unit and integration tests using Jest or similar frameworks
4. WHEN code quality matters THEN the system SHALL include ESLint configuration and code formatting with Prettier
