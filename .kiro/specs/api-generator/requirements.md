# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature is a web-based developer tool that enables users to generate complete, production-ready APIs from natural language descriptions. The tool will parse user prompts to extract data models, provide a visual model editor for refinement, and generate comprehensive API implementations including CRUD operations, authentication, and OpenAPI documentation. The generated projects will be downloadable or deployable, providing developers with a rapid prototyping and development solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input a natural language description of my application, so that I can quickly generate the foundational API structure without manual coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language prompt THEN the system SHALL parse the description and extract potential data models
2. WHEN the parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display the extracted models for user review
3. IF the prompt is ambiguous or incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions or request clarification
4. WHEN the user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL respond within 10 seconds with initial model extraction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to visually edit and refine the extracted data models, so that I can ensure the API structure matches my exact requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data models are extracted THEN the system SHALL display them in a visual editor interface
2. WHEN a user clicks on a model THEN the system SHALL allow editing of fields, types, and relationships
3. WHEN a user adds a new field THEN the system SHALL validate the field type and constraints
4. WHEN a user defines relationships THEN the system SHALL show visual connections between related models
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation in real-time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate complete CRUD operations for my models, so that I have a fully functional API without writing boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are finalized THEN the system SHALL generate CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE endpoints for each model
2. WHEN generating endpoints THEN the system SHALL include proper HTTP methods and status codes
3. WHEN relationships exist between models THEN the system SHALL generate nested and related resource endpoints
4. WHEN generating operations THEN the system SHALL include input validation and error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication and authorization built into my generated API, so that I can secure my application from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating an API THEN the system SHALL include JWT-based authentication endpoints
2. WHEN authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL generate login, register, and token refresh endpoints
3. WHEN protected routes are identified THEN the system SHALL add authentication middleware
4. WHEN role-based access is needed THEN the system SHALL generate authorization logic for different user roles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive OpenAPI documentation generated for my API, so that I can easily integrate with frontend applications and share with team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API is generated THEN the system SHALL create complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL include all endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements
3. WHEN the documentation is ready THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive Swagger UI interface
4. WHEN models change THEN the system SHALL automatically update the OpenAPI specification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to download or deploy my generated API project, so that I can immediately start using it in my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download option for the complete project
2. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL package all necessary files including source code, configuration, and documentation
3. WHEN the user chooses deployment THEN the system SHALL offer integration with popular cloud platforms
4. WHEN a project is downloaded THEN the system SHALL include setup instructions and dependency information
5. WHEN the generated project is run THEN the system SHALL ensure it works without additional configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated code to follow best practices and be production-ready, so that I can confidently use it in real applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL follow industry-standard patterns and conventions
2. WHEN generating database interactions THEN the system SHALL include proper connection pooling and error handling
3. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL implement proper logging and monitoring hooks
4. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive error handling and validation
5. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL organize files according to best practices

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview the generated API structure before finalizing, so that I can make adjustments without regenerating everything.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are defined THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the API structure and endpoints
2. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL display sample request/response payloads
3. WHEN the user wants to modify THEN the system SHALL allow returning to the model editor
4. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
