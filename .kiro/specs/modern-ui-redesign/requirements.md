# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current API Generator SaaS application has a functional but basic UI that needs modernization to compete effectively in the SaaS market. The interface currently uses standard Tailwind components with minimal visual hierarchy, basic typography, and lacks the polish expected from modern SaaS products. This feature aims to transform the UI into a modern, professional, and engaging interface that enhances user experience and builds trust with potential customers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential customer visiting the website, I want to see a modern and professional interface that builds confidence in the product, so that I feel comfortable investing time and potentially money in this SaaS solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user navigates through the application THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent modern design patterns throughout all pages
3. WHEN a user views the interface THEN the system SHALL use professional color schemes, spacing, and visual elements that convey trustworthiness
4. WHEN a user interacts with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and micro-interactions that feel polished

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want a chat-based interface with AI agents on the left and a tabbed workspace on the right, so that I can interact naturally with AI while having immediate access to generated code, models, and API previews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a split-screen layout with chat interface on the left (30-40% width) and tabbed workspace on the right
2. WHEN a user interacts with AI agents THEN the system SHALL provide a modern chat interface with message bubbles, typing indicators, and conversation history
3. WHEN a user receives AI responses THEN the system SHALL automatically populate relevant tabs (Code, Models, API Preview) with generated content
4. WHEN a user switches between tabs THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and maintain state across different views

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working with the tabbed workspace, I want multiple specialized tabs that show different aspects of my API project, so that I can easily switch between viewing code, data models, API documentation, and other relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in the workspace THEN the system SHALL provide tabs for Code, Models, API Preview, Documentation, Testing, and Deployment
2. WHEN a user clicks on the Code tab THEN the system SHALL display generated code with syntax highlighting and copy functionality
3. WHEN a user views the Models tab THEN the system SHALL show data model visualizations with relationships and properties
4. WHEN a user accesses API Preview THEN the system SHALL display interactive API documentation with example requests and responses
5. WHEN a user switches tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the current project context and provide smooth visual transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user chatting with AI agents, I want a modern chat interface that feels natural and responsive, so that I can communicate effectively about my API requirements and receive helpful guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL provide a modern chat input with auto-resize, send button, and keyboard shortcuts
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display the message in a styled bubble with timestamp and show typing indicators for AI responses
3. WHEN AI agents respond THEN the system SHALL display responses in distinct bubbles with agent avatars and support for formatted content (code blocks, lists, etc.)
4. WHEN a user scrolls through chat history THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling with message grouping and date separators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the modern interface to work seamlessly across all screen sizes, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a fully responsive modern design that adapts to screen size
2. WHEN a user interacts with mobile interface elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and mobile-optimized interactions
3. WHEN a user navigates on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive mobile navigation experience
4. WHEN a user views content on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability across all screen sizes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who values accessibility, I want the modern interface to be fully accessible, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my abilities or assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators and logical tab order throughout the modern interface
2. WHEN a user uses screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper semantic markup and ARIA labels for all modern UI components
